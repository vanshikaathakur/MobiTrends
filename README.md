📱 Mobile Market Trends Analysis (2025)

This project aims to analyze the mobile phone market trends across various regions using a dataset of smartphones launched globally. The analysis focuses on price, features, brand trends, and regional variations, with in-depth insights visualized using both Python (Jupyter Notebook) and Power BI.

🧾 Project Description
In this project:

Raw data from an Excel sheet was cleaned and preprocessed using Pandas and NumPy.

Unwanted characters and data inconsistencies were handled (e.g., "mAh", "inches", "₹", etc.).

Outliers were detected and managed to maintain data integrity.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Regional price comparison and feature-based analysis were performed.

A complete interactive Power BI dashboard was created for deeper business insights and data storytelling.
