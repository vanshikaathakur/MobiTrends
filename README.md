# 📊 Mobile Market Insights

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of the mobile phone market using data wrangling in Python and interactive data visualization in Power BI. It highlights trends in mobile phone launches, pricing, specifications, and brand-wise market performance across different countries.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to extract meaningful insights from a raw dataset of mobile phones launched in 2025 and present those insights using a professional dashboard. The project is divided into two main phases:

1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation** — Done using Python (Pandas) in Jupyter Notebook.
2. **Data Visualization** — Built using Microsoft Power BI.

## 📂 Project Structure

### 🔧 Data Cleaning (Python)

Performed in Jupyter Notebook using `pandas`. Key steps included:

- Reading the Excel dataset using `pd.read_excel()`
- Handling inconsistent formats (e.g., currency values like PKR, INR, USD, CNY, AED)
- Splitting/normalizing fields like RAM, Camera specs, and Launch Year
- Preparing cleaned data for import into Power BI

### 📊 Data Visualization (Power BI)

Created an interactive dashboard with filters and multiple charts, including:

- **Total Models Launched** (KPI tiles)
- **Launched Price by Country**
- **Brand-wise Revenue Tree Map**
- **Count of Models by RAM and Company**
- **Trend Analysis Over Time**
- **Sankey Diagram** showing relationships between Company, Model, RAM, Battery, and Screen Size
